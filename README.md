Generates a TailwindCSS color theme based on a chosen Brand color. Product probably already exists but novelty is not the goal.

### Ideas and Notes

- Choose primary color
- Choose secondary color from suggestions
- Generates tertiary and neutral colors
- Add as many other colors as you want
- Generate names for colors but allow custom names
- Use OpenAI to generate color names? (tested and it does work)
- save themes to local storage (no logins)
- generate Hex codes
- generate JSON to paste into `tailwind.config.ts`
- JSON includes shades 100, 200, ... 800, 900?
- Option to do semantic shading instead (lighter, light, normal, dark, darker)
- Probably simple enough for NextJS
- React color picker: https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/

### Things to learn

- Color theory
- Color calculation with math
- Copy to clipboard utility
- Good way to do multi-stage UX
